The latest diamond mine to be commissioned in Botswana is Boteti Diamond‟s A/K6 Karowe Mine, some 10km west of Debswana‟s Letlhakane Mine which opened in 2012.</div>

Currently, Damtshaa, Lerala, Ghaghoo and B/K11, all marginal mines in terms of profitability, are managed on a care and maintenance basis. However, Damtshaa Mine is expected to re-open during Q1 2018.</div>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pr-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Diamond production in Botswana has increased year on year, with the exception of two periods, 1990 to 1993 and 2008 - 2009, because of a planned reduction in output to match lower sales caused by global financial crises. In 1967, production amounted to 1000 carats only, from the Orapa Mine bulk sampling plant, but rose to a maximum annual production of 34.4 million carats in 2006 (Fig. 5).
<div>
</div><div>In diamond mining, the mine planning process involves the optimal exploitation of the kimberlite resource. The mine plan involves designing progressive “cuts” into the ground, which are developed in a series of “benches”, usually 12-16m in height.
</div><div><br></div><div>The slope angle of the cut depends on the strength of the country rock mass – the stronger country rocks, e.g. basalt, at the Debswana northern mines, may have slopes of up to 60 degrees, whereas the weaker rocks, such as mudstones, have much gentler slopes, of the order of 30 – 45 degrees.&nbsp;</div></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Since most kimberlite diatremes are carrot in shape, with the resource tapering at depth, there is usually a requirement to mine several successive cuts before reaching the end of open pit mine life and considering underground mining as further cuts are less or even uneconomical. The next cut to be mined at Jwaneng will be cut 9. 
<div>
</div><div>Let‟s take a closer look at Botswana‟s eight diamond mines, commencing with Debswana‟s four mines, which currently produce 99% of total diamond output in Botswana. Debswana is currently the world's second leading producer of gem diamonds by value, after the Russian company AlRossa.</div></div>

The mine began production in July 1971 and is the oldest of Botswana‟s diamond mines. The mine had to be linked to Francistown with a new

A bulk sampling plant was constructed on site in 1968 and the kimberlite ore grade was evaluated to be about 50 carats per hundred tons (cpht) but now stands at 80 cpht. Today, the area of excavation at surface measures about 120 hectares and the 290m deep pit measures 1.25 by 1.8km. </p><p>The planned life of the current open pit is to the year 2044 with a cut No. 3.

The expansion increased Orapa Mine‟s annual production from 6 million carats to 12 million carats from the No. 1 and No. 2 plants from the year 2000 and raised Debswana‟s total production to about 26 million carats in that year.

The mine which was first discovered during the sampling and evaluation process at Orapa, became Debswana's second mine when it opened in 1975. The mine has been managed from the larger Orapa operation. Two kimberlite pipes are mined, D/K1 (13 hectares) and D/K2 (2.2 hectares) (Fig. 8). The D/K1 pipe has a “trouser leg” morphology and the area of excavation on surface measures 88 hectares. <br><br>The current pit depth below ground level is about 400m and the pit dimension is 1.1 x 1.1km. Ore grade was about 30 cpht before the mine came to the end of its planned life in 2014, after which there is potential for mining underground. At its peak in 2011, Letlhakane Mine produced 1 million carats. The pit at D/K2 will be closed in 2017, when the total Letlhakane Mine tailings resource will begin to be mined up until the year 2040.</p>

<br>Four small diamond pipes (B/K1, B/K9, B/K12 and B/K
<br>15)	were discovered between 1967 and 1972 in an area 20km east of the Orapa kimberlite pipe. These pipes were grouped to form the Damtshaa Mine, the youngest of the Debswana mines which began operation in 2003, and are managed along with Letlhakane Mine from the Orapa operation. The ore grade for B/K9 and B/K12, the kimberlites currently mined, is about 29 cpht and annual production is a maximum of about 330,000 carats. B/K9, at 11.5 hectares, is the larger of the two mined pipes (Fig. 9) and has a current area of excavation of about 21 hectares, and a depth below surface of 50m.
<br>
<br>B/K 12 pipe area at surface measures 3.2 hectares and the current area of excavation is 7 hectares, with the pit bottom 63m below ground level. The mine has been on care and maintenance during 2017, but is scheduled to be brought back into production during Q1 2018.&nbsp;<br></p>

It contributes about 60-70% of Debswana‟s total revenue. The Jwaneng mine Aquarium plant is the first of its kind in the diamond mining industry. It has the completely automated diamond recovery plant (CARP) and the fully integrated sort house (FISH) (Fig. 12). This project brought to an end the hand sorting of diamonds in Botswana. High tech x-ray scanners used at this facility ensure quick and accurate diamond recovery and maximised
 profit. After sorting, the diamonds from all Debswana operations are cleaned by a process of acidisation at DTCB in Gaborone.&nbsp;</div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Currently Jwaneng is mining to a depth of about 350 metres and is expected to reach 624 metres at the end of Cut 8 mining. The resource consists of three separate volcanic pipes namely north, south and centre pipes and a small kimberlite sill in the south east which erupted through
 Transvaal strata and the overlying Karoo sediments about 245 million years ago. This is much older than the Orapa kimberlites at around 90 million years, but younger than the oldest mined kimberlites at Lerala, that have an age of ca. 1.3 billion years.&nbsp;</div>

The pit currently measures 1.6km by 2.4km and the life of open pit is currently scheduled up to 2035 (Cut 9), after which there is further potential for either a cut 10 or underground mining. Processing of the tailings resources commenced in 2015 and is currently planned to end in 2034.

Originally known as the “Martin Drift Kimberlites”, the 330,000 carat per year diamond mine, originally owned by DiamondEx limited, was fully commissioned in June 2008 at a cost of US$ 24 million.
<br>
<br>The five kimberlite pipes have a combined size of six hectares. The pipes are exposed at the surface and the indicated resource is 13.5 million tons of kimberlite at a grade of about 25.5 cpht. Life of mine is put at 10 years, but could possibly go deeper after that. The mine was put on a care and maintenance basis during the 2008 global financial crisis and has yet to re-commence mining (Fig. 13). In 2011, Lerala Mine was bought by Mantle Diamonds UK for US$3,250,000 and then re-sold to Kimberley Diamonds in 2016.&nbsp;<br></p>

 was found at the Lucara‟s Karowe Mine.</span></div><div><br></div><div>This is the largest stone found since the discovery of the Cullinan diamond in South Africa in 1902, 113 years ago, which measured 3106 cts. It was quickly followed by the discovery of two other large stones, measuring 813 cts (6th largest stone in the world) and 374 cts. The cutting and polishing of these stones is still to be undertaken. The largest cut and polished stone in the world is the Golden Jubilee, cut from the Cullinan diamond, and weighing 545.67 cts. The Karowe gem therefore offers a perfect opportunity to be cut into the largest ever finished diamond, carving Karowe mine and Botswana firmly into the diamond history books.</div></div>

Between 1978 and 1986, a Canadian company, Falconbridge, discovered no fewer than 79 kimberlites in Botswana, 19 of which were diamondiferous, the most successful discovery being the 10.3 hectare, economical, Gope 25 kimberlite, discovered in 1980. Gem Diamonds acquired the company Gope Exploration from De Beers and Xstrata in May 2007 for US$34 million. In 2011, the name of the mine was changed from Gope – ”Nowhere” to Ghaghoo – the Sesarwa name for the locally abundant tree – Acacia Luederitzii – False Umbrella Thorn.

The pipe is covered by 150m of overburden, comprising Kalahari sand and basalt. A trade off study was undertaken between open pit and underground, and the study showed it was more economical to establish an underground mine with a 8 degree, 450m long tunnel to access the ore. Gope‟s total resource is estimated at 20.5 million carats with a total average in situ value of US$3.3 billion. The average resource diamond price has been increased to US$162 per carat at a grade of about 22 cpht. Two blue diamonds were also recovered from the historical diamond samples during the course of valuation work. In late 2016, the mine was put on a care and maintenance program and is currently being considered for sale by owner Gem Diamonds.</div>
